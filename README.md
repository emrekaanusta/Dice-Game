# ðŸ§™ Web Development Projects ðŸ§™
Welcome to My Web Development Course Projects Repository! ðŸš€

Here you can find projects that I created throughout the course using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap...

Firstly we constructed our very first and very simple website introducing ourselves.

After creating a simple website and publishing it, we made a little more complex biographic website.

Then we created a fun website working as a dating site for dogs, TinDog.

After gaining a little styling experience, we started to use JavaScript in our projects. We made a site with to dices where winner change depending of the dice results every refresh.
